        <h2 id="about_me">About Me</h2>
        <p>I began my career in a completely different field. I trained in psychology and then completed a Masters in Social Work. I spent five years learning about substance abuse, trauma, relationships, and mental illness and how to help people around these complicated issues.</p>
        <p>Just as life can be complicated, I began to experience even more complications in my life that I didn't anticipate. I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and shortly after battled cancer. These major life experiences caused me to take a seriously look at my life. I began to realize that the life I had set up for myself was unworkable. I knew it was time to close the chapter on this part of my life and to create a chapter that would work better for me.</p>
        <p>I began considering all the different things that I could do that would work in the boundaries of having a chronic illess. That is when I began to explore my passion of technology. I started to mess around with coding and learning all about web design. I have been having a blast at learning a new language and having the ultimate challenge and puzzle. So here I am! Learning and growing skills in an area of life that I never would have imagined doing work in</p>
        <p>Of course, I am still passionate about the field of mental health. It is my hope that as a way of keeping ties with my previous training, that I can use my skills in technology to help those who will be on the frontlines doing the work. I remember what it was like feeling like I had to know everything and wear all hats, but now you can partner with someone who understands the field and can provide the help you need so you can focus on the clients.</p>
